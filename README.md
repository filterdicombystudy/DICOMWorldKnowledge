# DICOM World Knowledge

A place to store models for the classification of DICOM images.

Due to the complexity of medical data we expect that there is a critical number of experts that need to pool their knowledge on the classification of DICOM images. Once that critical number is reached a computer program can use that knowledge to intelligently guess types of DICOM data.

The project is a place to share the knowledge from all experts in a structured way.
